# Coordinate esolang


My first esolang that actually allows you to put functions in arguments. How crazy.

If you want, Please help me with cleaning up my code. I'm trying to right now. I have a problem with coding bad lol.

Run `node index.js [filename]`.

Please see the wiki.

You need `fs` and `prompt-sync`.
